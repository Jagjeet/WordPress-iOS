The annoying bug that kept users with author or contributor rights on self-hosted sites from being able to publish posts has been squashed. Publish away, authors!
Most of what changes in this update is small or behind-the-scenes — even if you don’t see them, you’ll feel them:
- There’s better support for translators, especially when they’re trying to translate things with dynamic elements, like email addresses and phone numbers. Ultimately, this means more people whose default language is something other than English will see better translations across the app.
- We’re continuing to polish the UI to make the app super-duper to use on an iPad — things like better margins and alignments, especially after rotating from landscape to portrait, that make the whole experience of using the app smoother.
